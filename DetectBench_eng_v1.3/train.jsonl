His desk was piled high with an assortment of books and notes, while the sunlight streaming through the ancient glass windows cast a particularly cozy glow on these pages. It was at this moment that he encountered a mechanics problem that completely baffled him. The problem seemed simple but concealed profound physical principles. It went as follows: In a quiet laboratory, a rope passed over a smooth and frictionless pulley, with a 10-pound weight hanging on one end and a lively, adorable little monkey on the other. The monkey, covered in brown fur with sparkling eyes, was in perfect balance with the weight. As the clever monkey began to climb up the rope, observers in the lab held their breath, eager to see what marvelous phenomenon would occur next. \"How strange,\" Carroll wrote in his notebook, \"many excellent mathematicians have given very different answers.\" Mr. Price believed that the weight would rise and gain speed; Clifton and Hacourt thought that the weight would ascend at the same speed as the monkey; whereas Sampson insisted that the weight would descend. A person claiming to be a distinguished mechanical engineer even said, \"This would be no more effective than a fly crawling on the rope,\" while an observer who prided themselves as a scientist thought that \"the rise or fall of the weight would depend on the reciprocal of the speed at which the monkey eats apples,\" and also needed to calculate the square root of the monkey's tail length.
