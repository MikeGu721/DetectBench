His residence was a five-story detached western-style house surrounded by green trees and fresh flowers. Although his paintings were very valuable, he never sold them, choosing instead to give them away to friends or charitable organizations. For convenience, he had installed a private elevator. Recently, his brother Wang Yuan became unemployed, so Wang Yong invited him to work as an assistant and also to help with his daily needs. The brothers got along well. One day, Wang Yong's classmate Lin Fang, who was also wheelchair-bound, visited him along with Mr. Zhu from a charity organization to discuss the possibility of donating to a hospital. When Lin Fang and Mr. Zhu arrived, Wang Yuan took the initiative to greet them and asked them to sit in the downstairs hall. Then, Wang Yuan used the intercom to speak with Wang Yong upstairs, requesting to bring the guests up to the fifth-floor studio, but Wang Yong insisted on coming downstairs to meet them. At that moment, the elevator stopped briefly on the fourth floor before descending. As soon as the elevator reached the ground floor and the automatic doors opened, they found Wang Yong dead inside the cramped elevator; a sharp short sword had pierced through the back of his neck, and a thick rubber rope was tied to the hilt of the sword. Wang Yuan entered the elevator, pushed out Wang Yong's body and wheelchair, checked his pulse, and found no heartbeat. \"Strange, could there be someone else in the fourth-floor studio?\" \"Besides the elevator, is there another stairway?\" Lin Fang and Mr. Zhu asked Wang Yuan. \"Hmm, there's a spiral staircase for emergencies. If the murderer is indeed upstairs, catching him would be like picking something out of a bag,\" replied Wang Yuan. \"Then let's split into two groups to search.\" Lin Fang took the elevator upstairs. Upon reaching the fourth floor, he saw no one. He glanced at Wang Yong's studio and noticed paintings scattered on the floor. At that moment, Wang Yuan also arrived breathlessly from the spiral staircase. Mr. Zhu used the phone in the studio to call the police and then followed Wang Yuan into the elevator shaft. After a while, only he emerged from it, covered in dust. The windows of the fourth-floor studio were barred with iron grills, so it was impossible for the murderer to escape through them. Wang Yong was murdered while descending in the elevator, which did not stop between the fourth and first floors; it was impossible for the murderer to escape without being seen by the three men.

He was accompanied only by a servant named Santini. Although the island's scenery was beautiful, for Napoleon, it felt more like a golden cage. He would walk by the sea every day, watching the waves repeatedly crash against the shore's rocks, as if they echoed his own feelings of helplessness and solitude. One day, he sent Santini to find the island's governor, Lowe, to convey his request for a doctor. By noon, Santini had not returned, but a young officer from the governor's office arrived to inform Napoleon that \"Your servant has been arrested on suspicion of theft.\" Napoleon hurried to the governor's office, where Lowe explained what had happened: \"When Santini arrived here, I was dealing with some gold coins handed over by the islanders and asked my secretary to have him wait in the room on the left. Later, I put the gold coins in this desk drawer and locked it before going to the restroom. Due to my negligence, I left the key on the desk. After two or three minutes, I returned and counted the gold coins in the drawer, only to find ten missing. During that time, Santini was waiting in the room on the left, and the key I had forgotten was on the desk. Who else could have stolen them if not him? Therefore, I ordered my secretary to arrest him.\" \"But you should know that the door on the left is locked; Santini couldn't have come in no matter what.\" \"He must have gone to the corridor and then entered through the middle door.\" \"Didn't you say you were only gone for two or three minutes? Santini couldn't possibly have seen you put the gold coins in the drawer from next door, nor would he know you left the key on the desk. With such a short time away, how could he have stolen the coins?\" Napoleon countered. \"He must have seen everything through the frosted glass.\" Napoleon didn't respond but walked over to the door on the left side of the room and peered through its frosted glass into the left room. He could only vaguely see some objects near the door; anything further away was unclear. He then went to both doors and touched their frosted glass, finding that both pieces had the same texture—one side smooth and one side rough—but on the left room's door, the rough side faced into Lowe's office, while on the right room's door, which led to the secretary's office, the smooth side faced into Lowe's office. Napoleon turned around and pointed at the frosted glass on the door, saying to Lowe: \"Come and see for yourself; from this frosted glass, Santini couldn't have seen what you were doing.

With no other choice, I agreed to take the case. He immediately pulled out a photo from his pocket. It was of a very beautiful woman, and he said shyly, \"This is my wife.\" \"Oh, she's very pretty!\" I responded, noting the typical May-December marriage. \"I'm busy with work all the time, and when she said she wanted to learn painting, I sent her to Tang Zhenshan's studio!\" \"Tang Zhenshan owes his success to my help, and I never imagined he would be so ungrateful!\" he said angrily. \"Has your wife ever mentioned anything to you?\" \"No, she hasn't said a thing, which is why I need to prove it.\" \"Where does she learn painting?\" \"At the Emperor Hao Building on Zhongxiao East Road; she's definitely there.\" Afterwards, I conducted a thorough investigation on Tang Zhenshan. It turned out he was quite skilled in painting and still unmarried. His flirtatious nature had won the hearts of many women, which also earned him quite a few enemies. I took the opportunity to sneak into his apartment when he was out and carefully planted a listening device. Luckily, the room next door was unoccupied, so I rented it for easier eavesdropping—all expenses paid by Wu Zhishun. Through the listening device, I learned that a man named Song Zheping often clashed with him over an award, which almost led to a bloody incident. I recorded all these conversations. As for the dialogues between Tang Zhenshan and Jiang Xiaoting, I listened even more intently and could confirm they indeed had an intimate relationship. However, Tang Zhenshan wasn't truly in love with her. I had no choice but to play the recordings for Wu Zhishun, who was furious to the point of exploding—I truly worried he might do something foolish!

{"id": 45, "context": "On a stormy night, in a solitary villa in the suburbs, Dr. Ding met with tragedy in his own home, shot dead by an assailant. The reclusive scholar rarely had visitors, and his body was discovered the following morning by his cleaning lady, Zhao Ma. Upon entering the study, Zhao Ma found Dr. Ding lying on the floor with a gunshot wound to his chest, surrounded by bloodstains. The room contained nothing out of the ordinary besides a desk, bookshelves, and a few chairs. A lamp with a shade hung from the ceiling, its 80-watt incandescent bulb still lit, illuminating Dr. Ding's body clad in formal attire. The sounds of wind and rain outside masked any potential clues. The windows were tightly shut, the heavy curtains drawn, but there was a noticeable bullet hole through both the curtain and the glass. The estimated time of death was around 9 p.m. the previous night.\n\nDetective Chief Zhao and his assistant Xiao Wang were dispatched to the scene, where they surveyed the room for any possible clues. The local security chief also arrived and briefly outlined the case: \"The perpetrator likely fired from the thicket across the yard, about 40 meters away. It was a precise shot.\" After hearing this, Chief Zhao expressed his doubts: \"The black curtains are thick; even with the lights on inside, it would be difficult to discern anything from outside. Moreover, Dr. Ding was shot directly under the light, so his shadow couldn't have been cast on the window. How then did the shooter aim so accurately? Was it just by chance?\" The security chief had no answer.\n\nChief Zhao then noticed the light switch by the door and pressed it a few times. The study's light flickered on and off without any abnormalities. Nighttime testing confirmed Chief Zhao's suspicion: \"Even if one could tell from the curtain gap whether the light inside was on, it's unbelievable that the criminal could hit the target with a single shot.\" The security chief was also puzzled.\n\nChief Zhao inquired about the events of the night of the incident and learned that Dr. Ding had two nephews—Li Ming and Li Xiang—both major suspects with motives to inherit his estate. On the night of the incident, both had dinner at their uncle's house and later talked in the living room. They reportedly left at 8:30 p.m., while Zhao Ma had left at 7:30 p.m. During that time, both nephews had entered the study separately—Li Ming to get cigarettes and Li Xiang to borrow a book. Dr. Ding himself never entered the study that evening. Both nephews' testimonies indicated that Dr. Ding saw them to the door and then closed it behind them. Tragically, after they left, Dr. Ding entered the study where he met his fate. The next morning when the crime was discovered, the front door was still securely locked, presenting a mystery akin to a locked-room scenario.\n\nAfter pondering for a moment, Chief Zhao suddenly opened his eyes and said to the security chief, \"According to Zhao Ma, was the study's light still on when she found the body?\" The security chief confirmed this detail. \"Then I know who the murderer is. The criminal cleverly used the light to take aim.\" Based on Chief Zhao's reasoning, which of Dr. Ding's nephews is the real culprit?", "options": ["Li Ming was shot under the light.", "Li Xiang was shot under the light.", "Zhao Ma was shot under the light.", "The security chief was shot under the light."], "answer": 1, "clue_graph": {"evidence": "Dr. Ding was shot -> The perpetrator is either Li Ming or Li Xiang\nThe light was on, Dr. Ding fell under it -> The perpetrator might have used the light to aim\nLi Xiang was the last one to enter the study -> Li Xiang had an opportunity to adjust the light setting", "multi_hop_reasoning": "Connecting these clues:\nDr. Ding was shot + The perpetrator is either Li Ming or Li Xiang -> The perpetrator is either Li Ming or Li Xiang\nThe light was on, Dr. Ding fell under it + Li Xiang had an opportunity to adjust the light setting -> Li Xiang might be the perpetrator\nThe perpetrator is either Li Ming or Li Xiang + Li Xiang might be the perpetrator -> The perpetrator is Li Xiang"}, "question": "Who is the real murderer in the case of Dr. Ding's killing?"}

{"id": 1186, "context": "After his crushing defeat at Waterloo, the once-dominant military genius Napoleon was exiled to the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena. The island was picturesque, but for Napoleon, who was accustomed to the thrill of the battlefield, it was a lonely prison. He lived under house arrest on the island, accompanied only by his loyal servant Santini. Santini was not just his servant but also his only friend on the island. One sunny day, with a gentle sea breeze blowing, Napoleon felt unwell and sent Santini to find the island's governor, Lowe, to request a doctor's visit. Santini set out as instructed but had not returned by noon. At that time, a young officer rushed from the governor's office to inform Napoleon: \"Your servant has been arrested on suspicion of theft.\"\n\nNapoleon was shocked and immediately went to the governor's office. Governor Lowe was pacing anxiously in his office and explained the situation to Napoleon upon his arrival: When Santini came here, I was busy counting gold coins that had been brought in by the islanders. As I was preoccupied, I asked my secretary to have him wait in the room on the left. After finishing my work, I put the gold coins in the desk drawer and locked it, but in my haste to use the restroom, I forgot that I had left the drawer key on the desk. When I returned to my office two or three minutes later and recounted the gold coins, I found that ten were missing. During this time, Santini had been waiting in the room on the left, and the drawer key had been left on my desk. Who else but him could have stolen them? Therefore, I ordered my secretary to arrest him.\n\nHowever, Napoleon did not believe that Santini would do such a thing. He began to observe the office and noticed that both doors had frosted glass panels. The rough side of the frosted glass on the left door faced into the governor's office, while the smooth side of the frosted glass on the right door faced into the governor's office. The room on the right was the secretary's office. Napoleon turned around and pointed at the frosted glass on the door, saying to Lowe: \"Come here and see for yourself; from this frosted glass, Santini could not have seen anything you did. The one who should be under suspicion is your secretary.\" Lowe summoned his secretary for questioning, and indeed, it was he who had stolen the gold coins.

{"id": 1198, "context": "At the foot of a picturesque mountain lies a historic academy of science, home to many renowned scientists and graduate students from both domestic and international backgrounds. Within the academy stands an ancient observatory tower, designed by a famous architect in the style of ancient Roman architecture. The four-story tower is adorned with exquisite bas-reliefs on each level, and the top floor features an open platform dedicated to astronomical observations. It was on this very platform that Yan Qin Xue tragically met his end. He was a young graduate student filled with curiosity about the universe, passionate about astronomical research, and often spent late nights observing the stars from the tower.\n\nOne dreadful morning, a terrible incident occurred at the academy. Yan Qin Xue was found dead on the highest platform of the observatory tower, with no apparent wounds on his body. Upon closer examination, it was discovered that his right eye had been pierced by a thin poison needle about 3 centimeters long. Next to his body lay a bloodstained needle. It seemed that Yan Qin Xue had pulled out the poison needle from his eye before succumbing to death. The incident has not been made public yet, and no clues have been uncovered. The entire academy is now in great turmoil over this matter.\n\nOn the day of the incident, the academy was supposed to hold its annual scientific research exhibition, but all activities were canceled due to the event. A tense and panicked atmosphere pervades the academy. The observatory tower is a separate unit, and its main door was locked; without a key, it is impossible to open, and there were no signs of forced entry. It is likely that Yan Qin Xue locked the door himself before going up to the platform. Therefore, it is speculated that the murderer did not enter through the tower's main door.\n\nThe platform is located on the south side of the fourth floor, approximately 26 meters above ground level. There is a river next to the observatory tower, and it is about 40 meters from the tower to the opposite bank. The wind was very strong last night, making it nearly impossible for the murderer to shoot the poison needle accurately from across the river into Yan Qin Xue's right eye. Yet, that is precisely how Yan Qin Xue was killed. So who is the murderer? And how was Yan Qin Xue killed? This is indeed a baffling case.\n\nThe dean of the academy is treating Yan Qin Xue's death as a suicide and plans to hold a simple funeral within the academy. However, who could believe that a graduate student with strong faith, an eagerness to learn, and a deep love for nature would choose such a way to end his life? The staff at the academy are all abuzz with speculation, especially Professor Pan, who was closest to Yan Qin Xue and disagrees with the conclusion drawn by the academy's authorities. Thus, an investigation was launched to find the murderer and seek justice for Yan Qin Xue.\n\nDuring the investigation, it was learned that Yan Qin Xue secretly observed the stars and moon every night from the observatory tower to better study space, never deterred by wind or rain. This further convinced Professor Pan that Yan Qin Xue was murdered rather than having committed suicide. After investigating several students close to Yan Qin Xue, it was revealed that he was the son of a wealthy businessman and had a half-brother. This summer, after their father passed away due to illness, Yan Qin Xue planned to donate his entire inheritance to the academy. However, his half-brother thought this was foolish and threatened to sue in court to stop him if he did not cease his actions immediately.\n\n\"The day before the incident, Yan Qin Xue's half-brother sent a small package. What was inside it, Yan Qin Xue did not tell anyone. When I came to clean the room yesterday, I did not see that small package; perhaps, the murderer poisoned Yan Qin Xue to steal it,\" said a cleaner at the academy to Professor Pan. The elderly professor closed his eyes in deep thought and then opened them again, gazing at the gently flowing river water. He then discussed with the police about uncovering the truth of the incident. \"This is my speculation based on common sense and observation; judging by the case details should not be too far off. Before making this public, could someone dredge this river? Although I have a clever deduction, without evidence, no one will confess guilt; my reasoning is merely hypothetical.\" Who murdered Yan Qin Xue?

{"id": 1217, "context": "On a serene spring afternoon, Dr. Ding was fatally shot in his study at his suburban villa. A renowned historian with an extensive personal library, Dr. Ding often hosted scholars for visits and exchanges. Tragically, his body was discovered the following morning by Zhao Ma, a long-serving housemaid for the Ding family. As usual, she was bringing fresh vegetables and milk to Dr. Ding. The study was elegantly furnished with ancient paintings on the walls and shelves filled with precious books. Dr. Ding, dressed in a dark suit, lay in the center of the room with a gunshot wound to his chest. The room's lighting was soft, with a lampshade-covered bulb hanging from the ceiling; the 80-watt incandescent bulb was still on, casting Dr. Ding's silhouette on the carpet. The windows were shut tight, the heavy curtains drawn, but there was a noticeable bullet hole through both the curtain and the glass. Preliminary investigations estimated the time of death to be around 9 p.m. the previous night.\n\nDetective Chief Zhao and his assistant Xiao Wang rushed to the scene upon receiving orders and meticulously examined every corner. The local security captain quickly briefed them on the case: \"We suspect the shooter fired from the thicket across the yard, about 40 meters away. A single shot hit the target, indicating expert marksmanship.\" However, Chief Zhao raised his doubts: \"The black curtains are thick, and even with the lights on inside, one couldn't see in from outside. Moreover, Dr. Ding was shot directly under the light; his shadow couldn't have been cast on the window. So how did the perpetrator aim so precisely? Was it just by chance?\" The security captain couldn't answer and agreed to conduct an experiment that night for verification.\n\nWhile waiting for nightfall to conduct the experiment, Chief Zhao noticed the light switch by the door and pressed it a few times. The study's light turned on and off without any anomalies. However, the experimental results confirmed Chief Zhao's suspicions: \"Even if one couldn't see inside through the gaps in the curtains, it's unusual for a criminal to hit their target with a single shot. Perhaps the perpetrator was very confident and aimed precisely.\" The security captain was puzzled.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that Dr. Ding had two nephews, Li Ming and Li Xiang, both major suspects. Dr. Ding was unmarried and childless, with no will left behind; his estate would be inherited by these two nephews. On the night of the murder, both had dinner with Dr. Ding and conversed in the living room until 8:30 p.m. before leaving. Zhao Ma had left at 7:30 p.m. Both nephews had separately entered the study before leaving: Li Ming to get cigarettes and Li Xiang to borrow a book. Dr. Ding himself had not entered the study at all that evening. Both mentioned these details in their statements and said that Dr. Ding had seen them to the door before closing it behind them. Shortly after entering the study alone, Dr. Ding was attacked. The next morning when the crime was discovered, the front door was still securely locked, presenting a locked-room murder scenario.\n\nThe two nephews lived in separate apartments. After saying goodbye, they claimed to have gone their separate ways home—one to the left and one to the right. After pondering for a moment, Chief Zhao suddenly opened his eyes and said to the security captain: \"According to Zhao Ma, was the study's light still on when she found the body?\" The security captain replied: \"Yes, it was.\" Chief Zhao then declared: \"Then I know who the murderer is.

{"id": 1313, "context": "After his crushing defeat at Waterloo, the once-dominant military genius Napoleon was exiled to the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena. The island was picturesque, but for the formerly powerful Napoleon, it was akin to a prison at the ends of the earth. He lived under a form of house arrest on the island, accompanied only by a loyal servant named Santini. Santini was not just his servant but also his sole friend and companion in isolation.\n\nOne day, feeling unwell, Napoleon sent Santini to find the island's governor, Lowe, to convey his request for a doctor. The weather on the island was unpredictable, and although it was clear when Santini set out, a thick fog soon rolled in. By noon, Santini had not returned, and Napoleon began to feel uneasy. At that moment, a young officer from the governor's office arrived to inform Napoleon: \"Your servant has been arrested on suspicion of theft.\"\n\nNapoleon hurried to the governor's office, where Lowe recounted the events: \"When Santini arrived, I was dealing with some gold coins handed over by the islanders and asked my secretary to have him wait in the room on the left. Later, I placed the gold coins in a drawer of this table and locked it before going to the restroom. Due to my negligence, I left the drawer key on the table. After two or three minutes, I returned and counted the gold coins in the drawer, only to find ten missing. During this time, Santini was waiting in the room on the left, and the key I had forgotten was on the table. Who else but him could have stolen them? Therefore, I ordered my secretary to arrest him.\"\n\n\"But you should know that the door on the left is locked; Santini couldn't have come in no matter what,\" Napoleon retorted.\n\n\"He must have gone down the corridor and entered through the central door,\" insisted Governor Lowe.\n\n\"Didn't you say you were only gone for two or three minutes? Santini couldn't possibly have seen you put the coins in the drawer from next door, nor would he know you left the key on the table. With such a short time away, how could he have stolen the coins?\" Napoleon continued to challenge him.\n\n\"He must have seen everything through the frosted glass,\" Lowe tried to explain.\n\nNapoleon said nothing but walked over to the door on the left side of the room. He pressed his face against the frosted glass and peered into the left room, only able to vaguely make out some objects near the door; anything further away was unclear. He then went to both doors and touched their frosted glass, finding that both pieces had the same texture—one side smooth and one side rough—but on the left room's door, the rough side faced into Lowe's office, while on the right room's door, which led to the secretary's office, the smooth side faced into Lowe's office. Napoleon turned around and pointed at the frosted glass to Lowe: \"Come and see for yourself; from this glass, Santini couldn't have seen anything you did. The one who should be under suspicion is your secretary.\" When Lowe confronted his secretary, it turned out he was indeed the thief.\n\nWhat was Napoleon's basis for deducing that the secretary was the real thief?", "options": ["The secretary took advantage of the properties of frosted glass to steal the coins.", "Santini entered Lowe's office through a locked door to steal the coins.", "Napoleon noticed traces on the table that had been moved.", "The secretary had a previous record of stealing coins."], "answer": 0, "clue_graph": {"evidence": "Napoleon's servant arrested -> Santini suspected as thief\nGovernor Lowe's explanation -> Santini had opportunity to access coins and key\nNapoleon's observation -> Properties and position of frosted glass\nAfter associating clues:\nSantini suspected as thief + Santini had opportunity to access coins and key -> Santini could be thief\nProperties and position of frosted glass + Santini could be thief -> Santini couldn't have seen inside room through frosted glass\nSantini couldn't have seen inside room through frosted glass + Secretary had opportunity to access coins and key -> Secretary is real thief", "multi_hop_reasoning": "From clues given in the problem:\nNapoleon's servant arrested -> Santini suspected as thief\nGovernor Lowe's explanation -> Santini had opportunity to access coins and key\nNapoleon's observation -> Properties and position of frosted glass\nAfter associating clues:\nSantini suspected as thief + Santini had opportunity to access coins and key -> Santini could be thief\nProperties and position of frosted glass + Santini could be thief -> Santini couldn't have seen inside room through frosted glass\nSantini couldn't have seen inside room through frosted glass + Secretary had opportunity to access coins and key -> Secretary is real thief"}, "question": "What was the basis for Napoleon's deduction that the secretary was the real thief?"}
{"id": 1322, "context": "On the morning of May 10, 1990, at 9:30 am, by the riverside brimming with the essence of spring, sunlight filtered through the blue sky and white clouds, casting its glow on the shimmering water. The luxurious \"Iceberg\" yacht sailed upstream on the tranquil river. Passengers either stood on the deck enjoying the gentle breeze or sat inside savoring fine wine and cuisine. Amidst this picturesque setting, an unsettling incident occurred. Mrs. Sharl, clad in black mourning attire and looking haggard, hurriedly approached the captain. Her voice was laden with urgency and panic: \"It's terrible, the urn I brought with me has disappeared!\" The captain, who had been discussing the navigation route with his first mate, chuckled dismissively at the sudden news: \"Madam, don't worry! Think about it, it's unlikely that anyone would steal an urn, right?\" Mrs. Sharl's forehead glistened with more sweat as she insisted, \"No, no!\" She explained further, \"It contains not only my father's ashes but also three diamonds worth 30,000 marks.\" Before World War II, Mrs. Sharl's father, Professor Kolen, accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Toronto in Canada. After the war broke out, he stayed in Canada due to his dissatisfaction with Hitler's fascist regime. Decades passed, and Professor Kolen lived abroad alone until his eldest daughter, Mrs. Sharl, came to care for him in Canada. This spring, Professor Kolen fell gravely ill and was bedridden. In his final moments, he entrusted his daughter to bring his ashes back to Germany and to convert his life savings into diamonds to be distributed among his three daughters in Germany. Mrs. Sharl lamented to the captain: \"That's why I've always kept the urn close to me. I thought no one would steal an urn, but before I could return home and my sisters could see our father's ashes... today...\" Upon hearing the full story, the captain immediately investigated everyone who had entered Mrs. Sharl's cabin and recorded the following information—Mrs. Sharl's friend Floss: Entered the cabin around 9 am to chat with Mrs. Sharl; left at 9:05 am because maid Anna came to tidy up the room, and they chatted on the upper deck. Mrs. Sharl herself: Returned to her cabin at 9:10 am to retrieve her camera and found maid Anna rummaging through her bedside table. Mrs. Sharl angrily reprimanded her. The two argued for 10 minutes until 9:20 am; at 9:25 am, her friend Floss re-entered the cabin to invite Mrs. Sharl to admire the scenery from the bridge deck, but Mrs. Sharl declined due to her troubled state of mind. At 9:30 am after the maid left, Mrs. Sharl discovered that the urn had vanished... If Mrs. Sharl's account is credible, then the thief must be either Anna or Floss, but it was unclear who it was. While perplexed, a crew member reported to the captain: \"I vaguely saw a small purple-red wooden box bobbing up and down in the waves at the stern of the boat.\" The captain rushed to the stern and indeed saw as reported. He decisively ordered a return search. It was now 10:30 am. By 11:45 am they finally caught up with the small wooden box drifting downstream on the river surface and retrieved it. Mrs. Sharl identified it as her father's urn, but the three diamonds inside were gone. The captain then took out his notebook and carefully analyzed the recorded information, ultimately determining who had pried open the urn to steal the diamonds and then tossed it into the river. The conclusion of solving the case was consistent with the captain's deduction.

{"id": 1323, "context": "On a serene and sunny spring afternoon, the flora within the Academy of Sciences was bursting with vitality. Students were either discussing academic issues in small groups or deeply engrossed in their books alone. However, the tranquility was shattered by a tragedy that occurred the previous morning. A graduate student named Yan Qin Xue was found dead on the highest platform of the observatory tower, with no apparent wounds on his body. Upon closer examination, it was discovered that his right eye had been pierced by a thin poison needle about 3 centimeters long. Next to his body lay a bloodstained needle. It seemed that Yan Qin Xue had pulled out the needle from his eye before dying. The incident had not been made public yet, and no clues had been uncovered, causing significant unrest within the entire Academy.\n\nThe observatory tower is a separate unit, and its main door was locked. Without a key, it would be impossible to open, and there were no signs of forced entry. It is likely that Yan Qin Xue locked the door himself before going up to the platform. Therefore, it is presumed that the murderer did not enter through the tower's main door. The platform is located on the south side of the fourth floor, approximately 26 meters above ground level. There is also a river next to the observatory tower, and it is about 40 meters across from the tower to the opposite bank. The previous night there was a strong wind, making it highly improbable for the murderer to have shot the poison needle accurately into Yan Qin Xue's right eye from across the river.\n\nYet, Yan Qin Xue was indeed killed by a poison needle striking his right eye. So who could the murderer be? And how was Yan Qin Xue killed? This case is truly baffling. The dean of the Academy of Sciences treated Yan Qin Xue's death as a suicide and planned to hold a simple funeral within the academy. But who could believe that a graduate student with strong faith, an eagerness to learn, and a deep love for nature would choose such a way to end his life?\n\nAt this time, everyone in the Academy was discussing the matter fervently, especially Professor Pan, who was close to Yan Qin Xue and disagreed with the academy's conclusion. An investigation was launched to find the murderer and seek justice for Yan Qin Xue. During the investigation, it was learned that Yan Qin Xue had been observing the stars and moon every night at the observatory tower to better study space, never deterred by wind or rain. This further convinced Professor Pan that Yan Qin Xue was murdered rather than having committed suicide.\n\nProfessor Pan investigated several students who were close to Yan Qin Xue and learned that he was the son of a wealthy businessman with a half-brother from the same father. This summer, after their father passed away due to illness, Yan Qin Xue planned to donate his entire inheritance to the Academy of Sciences. However, his half-brother thought this was foolish and threatened to sue in court to stop Yan Qin Xue's actions and prohibit his inheritance rights if he did not cease immediately.\n\n\"The day before this incident occurred, Yan Qin Xue's half-brother sent him a small package. What was inside the package, Yan Qin Xue did not tell anyone. Yesterday, when I came to clean the room, I did not see that small package either. Perhaps, the murderer killed Yan Qin Xue to steal that small package,\" said a janitor at the academy to Professor Pan. The elderly Professor Pan closed his eyes in deep thought and then opened them again, gazing at the gently flowing river water. At this point, Professor Pan discussed the true nature of the incident with the police.\n\n\"This is my conjecture based on common sense and observation; judging by these factors, we won't be far off from understanding the case. Before the case is made public, could someone dredge this river? Although I have a brilliant deduction, without evidence, no one will confess guilt willingly. My reasoning is merely hypothetical,\" said Professor Pan. So now the question arises: In this mysterious case, who is the murderer of Yan Qin Xue?

He used to live in one of those elegant villas on Central Street, but due to some undisclosed troubles, he had to move to an old apartment building on Palm Street. Officer Ward remembered that Raymond was a bachelor and, although his living conditions had worsened, it seemed to be enough for him.\n\nWhen Officer Ward arrived at the scene, Raymond was anxiously waiting at the door. They entered the living room downstairs together, and Raymond, pale-faced, recounted what had happened: \"I came home early this afternoon and found the door lock had been picked. I hurriedly pushed the door open, and suddenly someone rushed out holding a book. I instinctively tried to catch him, but he broke free from me and disappeared across the street. With no other choice, I had to call the police from the phone booth at the door.\" Officer Ward frowned and asked, \"Have you checked? Is anything else missing from your home?\" Raymond shook his head and said, \"After making the call, I stayed here to protect the scene and haven't entered any other rooms yet!\" Officer Ward found it odd: \"Is a book worth such urgency?\" Raymond replied: \"Officer, you don't understand, this is not just any book; it's a unique copy in the world, worth over $200,000! I had it locked in a bookcase upstairs, but the thief was too cunning, bringing tools to pry open the bookcase and steal this most valuable book!\"\n\nOfficer Ward followed Raymond upstairs and indeed found that the lock on the bookcase had been pried off. He asked, \"Did you insure this book?\" Raymond's eyes flickered for a moment before he answered, \"I did... but...\" Officer Ward cut him off: \"Enough, stop acting.

On-duty Officer Schneider was lying half-asleep on his sofa when the alarm phone by his bed rang urgently. He opened his eyes and quickly grabbed the receiver. A woman's anxious and trembling voice came through: \"Is this the police station?\" \"Yes, miss, what can I do for you?\" Schneider replied. \"My name is Teresa, someone has killed my husband, please come right away.\" Schneider noted her address, got dressed, and rushed out. Outside, it was icy and bone-chillingly cold, \"Damn this ghastly weather!\" Schneider cursed as he climbed into the patrol car. Forty minutes later, he arrived at Mrs. Teresa's house.

The room was warm, and Schneider took off his scarf, hat, and gloves, shedding his thick coat, and sized up the woman before him.

Bob's house was situated on a vast meadow surrounded by lush trees, with rolling hills in the distance. Aro parked on the pebble-covered driveway, with light and cheerful jazz music playing in the van. It took him about two minutes to fill out the morning's delivery form before he took out a dress and a suit from the van. As he closed the van door, he realized that the wheel was right on top of the garden's rubber hose, forcing him to get back into the vehicle and reverse a few meters. Thus, he drove into Bob's empty garage. At that moment, Aro noticed that the door leading from the garage to the kitchen was open. He went inside and found Mrs. Bob unconscious beside the stove. \"Mrs. Bob, wake up, what happened to you?\" Aro shouted loudly. After failing to rouse her, Aro suddenly realized that Mrs. Bob might be dead. Panicked, he cried out, \"Somebody help, please!\" At this point, Mr. Bob came running over and picked up his wife from the ground, calling out loudly. \"We should call an ambulance!\" Aro suggested. After a while, an ambulance took Mrs. Bob to the hospital. Detective Hawk was ordered by his superiors to handle this murder case. He called Aro to the police station for questioning, and Aro detailed everything that happened that day. A subsequent lie detector test proved that Aro was telling the truth. Hawk then summoned Mr. Bob: \"Mr. Bob, what were you doing at the time of the incident?\" \"I was alone in the garden watering the plants. About half an hour later, I saw the laundry service's delivery van drive into my garage.

The streets were deserted, save for a few stray cats darting around trash cans in search of food. At a corner of the main street stood a gas station, and opposite it, an old bar with a long history. The bar's exterior was quaint, with weathered wooden doors and windows that bore the marks of time. Travelers on the road would stop at the gas station for fuel and often liked to pop into the bar for a couple of drinks and a rest. Despite its remote location, the bar did good business. However, on this peaceful and serene night, a homicide occurred in the bar! Sheriff Bolton received the report and immediately rushed to the scene. Inside the bar, he found a young man lying on the ground, muscular and with disheveled hair. Blood flowed from the back of his head, forming a large pool that looked particularly horrifying under the dim light. There was a bullet hole behind his left ear; the bullet had entered there, piercing his brain and killing him instantly. The shooter was Ram, the bar's owner. He was pale and seemed very nervous. After a long pause, he said shakily, \"The patrons here come from all over, and it's quite a mixed crowd. Some thugs often come to cause trouble. To prevent robberies, I prepared a handgun, which is registered with the police.\" \"I know all that, just tell me why you shot him!\" Sheriff Bolton interrupted. Ram nodded and continued, \"About 10 minutes ago, there was only one customer left in the bar, lying motionless on the table. I thought he was drunk and went over to ask if he was feeling unwell.

The plane trees on both sides of the street swayed gently in the breeze, and passersby weaved through them, enjoying the leisure of the weekend. Suddenly, Henry heard a cry for help coming from an alley. He immediately put down his coffee and rushed towards the source of the sound. Upon arrival, he saw a woman sitting on the ground looking disheveled, rubbing a swelling on the back of her head, seemingly in great pain. The woman, named Ruth, was an employee at a jewelry store. She told Detective Henry that she was on her way to deliver jewelry to a customer who had placed an order when she was followed and attacked by an unidentified person. Ruth recalled, \"I had just left when I felt someone following me. I was scared but didn't think much of it and turned into this alley. Just as I got here, I heard footsteps behind me, and before I could turn around to see clearly, I was hit on the head.

Based on the clues provided by Ruth, the police launched a citywide manhunt and eventually narrowed down two suspects. One was named Mills, who worked at a nearby deli; the other was named Knight, a homeless man who scavenged along the streets. Mills tried to run when he saw the police but explained, \"I was running because my lunch break was over, and I didn't want to be late.\" Knight claimed, \"I didn't want to wear this cardigan.

Acting decisively on these clues, the police engaged in a fierce shootout and killed the robber.

Coach B, a rising star in coaching, led his rugby team in a friendly match at a stadium 60 minutes away from the crime scene. Despite it being a friendly match, Coach B and his team took the opportunity very seriously, hoping to demonstrate their strength. Coach C was an ambitious young coach whose team was playing in a championship match at a stadium 20 minutes away from the crime scene. Coach C's positive attitude and passion for the game had inspired his entire team.\n\nAccording to the police investigation, all three coaches were on the sidelines directing their teams until the end of their matches, with no interruptions during the games. It seemed that none of the suspects had time to commit the crime. Detective Hawk paced back and forth in his office, pondering every detail of the case. He suddenly stopped, turned to his assistant, and said, \"Bring me all three coaches.\" At the police station, the coaches answered questions about the outcomes of their matches. Coach A calmly stated, \"We ended in a draw with our opponents and had to decide the winner by penalty shootout.\" Coach B sighed and said, \"Alas, we lost, with a score of 6 to 15.\" Coach C was visibly thrilled and excitedly exclaimed, \"3 to 1—we won the championship!\" After hearing their responses, Hawk sneered at one of them and said, \"It seems you'll need to stay and have a thorough talk with us.\" Do you know who it is? Why?", "options": ["Coach A, because his team went into extra time and a penalty shootout, so he could have had time to reach the crime scene.", "Coach B, because his team lost the match, which could have given him a motive to commit the crime.", "Coach C, because his team won the championship but the match duration was short, making it possible for him to reach the crime scene at the time of the crime.", "All coaches have alibis and none had time to commit the crime."], "answer": 2, "clue_graph": {"evidence": "The start times and locations of each coach's match -> Infer their earliest possible arrival times at the crime scene.\nThe outcomes of each coach's match -> Infer the possible duration of their matches.", "multi_hop_reasoning": "The conclusion is drawn: Coach C is the suspect."}, "question": "Mr. Robbins was murdered, and three team coaches became suspects, all of whom had alibis for not being present at the time of the match.

The scenery is magnificent, with the canyon walls on both sides etched with the marks of time. The trio has set up tents and has been rooted here for a week. Every day, they busily document each artifact they find within the ruins. One night, Allen went out alone for an inspection and never returned. The next morning, as the first rays of sunlight entered the canyon, someone found Allen's body at the bottom of a cliff by the river, appearing to have fallen off and died in what seemed to be an accidental incident. A forensic examination determined that Allen died around 10 p.m. the previous night. During the investigation at the scene, the police found a letter \"I\" written in the sand next to the deceased's right hand. \"Could this be the victim's last words? He must have been trying to tell us who the killer is,\" Detective Locke speculated. \"That Ian guy is suspicious; his name starts with an 'I',\" Officer Brown replied. Hearing this, Ian immediately defended himself, \"Don't joke around, I was at the hotel all night, how could I have killed anyone?\" \"Allen died instantly from a broken neck. Where were you at 10 p.m. last night?\" Officer Brown asked. \"I was alone in my room with no witnesses. But if I'm under suspicion, Cook should be too.\" \"What are you talking about?!\" Cook exclaimed angrily at Ian. \"Isn't it true? Yesterday Allen found a lot of pottery by chance, and you asked to study it with him but got rejected.\" \"What does that prove? Haven't you said similar things? Besides, that old man Ralph is also very suspicious,\" Officer Brown continued to inquire. \"Which Ralph?\" \"The one who is well-versed in local history. He was surveying the ruins alone and became angry when we joined; he wouldn't answer any of our questions.\" After hearing Cook's statement, Officer Brown fell into deep thought. Suddenly, he had an idea and looked up to ask, \"Allen wore his watch on his right hand, so Ian, Allen must have been left-handed, right?\" \"Correct!\" Ian replied. \"One more question, Mr. Cook, how long have you known Allen?\" \"We just met yesterday.\" \"Very well, I know who the murderer is!\" Officer Brown confidently stated.

However, this peaceful scene was shattered by a scream—the janitor discovered Moya's body in front of his desk. Moya was a talented lawyer whose chest had been pierced by a sharp fruit knife, the blade still lodged in the wound. After a preliminary examination, the medical examiner deduced that Moya's time of death was around 6 p.m. the previous day.\n\nDetective Locke rushed to the scene upon receiving the report. An experienced and perceptive investigator, he had an acute eye for details of a case. His first inquiry was with Moya's newlywed wife, Lisa. A gentle and beautiful woman, she was overwhelmed with tears upon hearing the tragic news, barely able to compose herself: \"We've been married for just over half a year. He was the most romantic and honest man I've ever met. How could someone kill him?\" She reminisced about the loving details of their time together.\n\nFisher, Moya's partner at the law firm and his longtime friend, expressed disbelief at Moya's death: \"I trusted Moya completely; he was not only my partner but also a respected lawyer. When I left yesterday, he was still working overtime in the office. I went to the gym afterward. I always envied Moya's healthy physique and tanned skin, but I would never bear him any ill will.\"\n\nDuring his investigation, Detective Locke uncovered some secrets unknown to others.

When the police informed her of Moya's death, she showed disbelief and was deeply saddened: \"Moya was with me yesterday afternoon at my apartment. That bastard! He said he wasn't married, and he had been pursuing me madly for the past two months. I thought he was going to propose to me soon.\" When Locke revealed to her that Moya was married, Katherine's sorrow turned into anger.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of Moya's body, Detective Locke and his assistant discovered a crucial clue: there was a distinct ring mark on Moya's left ring finger.

He was there to visit an old friend but unexpectedly became entangled in an accidental case. As soon as he stepped into the lobby, a commotion from upstairs reached his ears: first angry arguing, then a woman's scream, and finally a dull thud of someone hitting the ground. Detective Merton immediately realized the gravity of the situation and rushed up the stairs to the second floor. At the end of the dimly lit corridor, the door to a room stood wide open, revealing a gruesome scene: Lawyer Wilson lay on the floor with a spring knife in his chest, still clutching a half-smoked cigar in his hand. Scattered on the floor were an overturned wastepaper basket, a cheap lighter, and a blank note. On the desk, there was a telephone, a glass, and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. Detective Merton looked around and noticed that no one else had come to gawk. So he began to question each office on the second floor.\n\nFirst, he knocked on Helen's door; she was a physiotherapist who usually provided massage therapy. Helen told Merton that she had been in her room all day and hadn't heard any unusual noises. \"I didn't hear anything,\" Helen said as she removed her headphones, \"Wilson was killed? That's not surprising at all; he deceived everyone here, and everyone hated him.\" Next, Merton knocked on the door of the second office, where he found the painter Murray holding a paintbrush in one hand and an unlit cigar in the other. \"I did hear a scream, but I was focused on my painting at the time. You know, you can hear all sorts of noises in this building,\" Murray said before extending the cigar and asking, \"Do you have a lighter? Can I borrow some fire?\" Lastly, Merton visited the room of Silva, a blind masseur. Silva told Merton that he too had been at home with nothing to do. \"I heard someone scream; what happened?\" After Merton recounted the incident to him, he noticed Silva holding an ice pick. \"Oh, I was defrosting the fridge,\" Silva said as he walked to the corner and opened the fridge door, \"Would you like a drink or a cigar?

He had two nephews and one niece: the astute and capable Chuck, the quiet and reserved Dean, and the lively and adorable Jenny.

Five British tourists boarded the \"Lucky\" sailboat docked at the harbor, under the caress of the sea breeze, embarking on their long-awaited adventure. These five tourists each had their own story: 26-year-old Jack was the owner of a prestigious pharmacy in London, always dressed in a neat suit, giving off the impression of a refined scholar; 49-year-old Henry ran a general store, his slightly weathered face and a slight limp in his left leg were memorable; 50-year-old George was an experienced taxi driver, his head full of silver hair and his honest smile made him approachable; the other two, Blake and Rochette, were both over sixty, dressed in loose shirts and shorts, looking like retirees enjoying life. Their purpose was to sail along the legendary pirate trails, weaving through the Lesser Antilles and finally reaching the Leeward Islands—a haven for pirates to hide their treasure and seek shelter from storms three hundred years ago.\n\nAt 4:30 PM, the boat docked. The five tourists stepped onto a path flanked by bushes and weeds as tall as a person. Blake suddenly stopped, plucked a bunch of weed-like plants, and showed them to Jack. \"Look, Jack, who would have thought such plants grew on this deserted island!\" Blake exclaimed in surprise. \"What plant is this?\" Jack asked curiously. \"You don't recognize it? This is Ophiopogon japonicus, a medicinal herb used to make tonics,\" Blake explained. As they spoke, they rounded a mound of earth to find a decrepit yet mysterious castle standing before them.

Dr. Harris, a researcher with some fame in the field of military technology, was found dead next to his desk, a fruit knife deeply embedded in his chest. The lab was in disarray, clearly having been the scene of a fierce struggle. Dr. Harris had been dedicated to developing a new type of missile control module, and the data for this significant achievement, stored on his computer, mysteriously disappeared after the crime. The police initially deduced that the murder was directly connected to the theft of the missile control module.\n\nThat evening, as heavy rain poured down, few people were out and about on campus. According to the autopsy report, Dr. Harris's time of death was around 10:00 PM. The lab's security door was not locked, and there were clear signs of tampering at the scene. The disk storing the data was violently smashed, but aside from the missing control module, there were no other significant losses. The next morning, a cleaner named Mary discovered the tragedy while cleaning. She recalled that the lab's power was not cut off at the time, but the computer had been shut down. The police investigation revealed that the system copy time was recorded at 9:54 PM, consistent with the estimated time of Dr. Harris's death. Notably, only Dr. Harris himself knew the computer system's password; any attempt to copy without it would trigger automatic data destruction.\n\nOn the night of the incident, a teacher named Johnson was working late in an office opposite the lab. He remembered seeing the lights on in the lab at around 9:40 PM, but when he looked again at 10:10 PM, they were off. Puzzlingly, within a few minutes, the lights came back on but only lasted for about a minute before going out again.\n\nAfter investigating, the police narrowed down three suspects: The first suspect was visiting scholar Emmons, a computer expert suspected of espionage but lacking direct evidence. He left his hotel at 8:00 PM and returned at 10:20 PM, claiming to have gone to admire San Francisco's night view. However, witnesses reported seeing him loitering near the lab around 10:00 PM. Upon returning to his hotel, he immediately booked a flight back to his home country for the following day. The second suspect was Dr. Harris's girlfriend and partner Diaz, who was seen having a heated argument with Harris at 9:30 PM on the night of the incident. Her roommate confirmed she didn't return to their room until after midnight. Diaz claimed she went for a walk alone on campus after a minor dispute with Harris and felt upset, but no one could provide her with an alibi. Notably, she was the only other person who knew the computer system's password. The third suspect was Dr. Harris's mentor, Professor Stephen, who had argued with Harris over academic plagiarism the day before the murder. Professor Stephen claimed he spent the entire evening reading in his office downstairs from the lab until 11:00 PM and heard no unusual noises—though it is true that the lab is well soundproofed.\n\nThe police conducted thorough searches of all three suspects' residences, offices, and labs but did not find the disk containing the module data.

How so?\" the intrigued officer asked. \"I stepped hard on the thief's instep with my heel; there must be an imprint of my shoe heel on it,\" Anna explained. Earlier on the train, she had smelled smoke and then felt a man reach towards her chest from behind. Aware that pickpockets in Tokyo often commit crimes on subways and that calling out could lead to being stabbed, she didn't dare to shout. In desperation, pretending to be pushed by someone in front, she stomped her heel back hard... Following Anna's advice, the police had male passengers remove their shoes for inspection at the exit. Sure enough, they found a man with a swollen mark on his left instep that matched the shape of Anna's shoe heel. The police took him to the duty room and found Anna's wallet on him. It turned out that the pickpocket had used harassment to distract her before stealing. Later, someone asked Anna how she knew she had stepped on the pickpocket and not another passenger.

Chief Inspector Mears, a seasoned and insightful detective, led his team on a citywide manhunt. They navigated through bustling streets, investigated countless leads and suspects, and eventually apprehended several key criminals in an abandoned factory. However, despite various interrogation techniques, the whereabouts of the artworks remained a mystery. Just when Mears felt at a loss, the mastermind cracked under pressure and confessed that the artworks were hidden beneath a millstone on a farmer named Bauer's property.\n\nMears immediately organized a team and drove to Bauer's farm. The farm was nestled in the vast countryside, surrounded by golden wheat fields and lush green meadows. The police cars stopped at the entrance of the farm, and Mears and his assistants quickly disembarked and headed straight for the millstone. Bauer's face flickered with panic upon seeing the police but soon regained composure. He complained about the day's heat, insisted he was a law-abiding citizen who had never wronged the government, and threatened to complain to the farmers' association.\n\nMears ignored Bauer's complaints and threats. He ordered his assistants to move the millstone and began digging. After a long excavation that yielded nothing but soil and rocks, Mears jumped into the pit to inspect it and noticed a section of the pit wall mixed with fresh wheat stems. This led him to realize that Bauer might have been tipped off and moved the artworks.\n\nStanding at the edge of the pit in contemplation, Mears recalled Bauer's previous glance towards the threshing floor and connected it with the wheat stems on the pit wall. He suddenly told his assistants, \"We don't need to dig anymore; follow me to the yard.\" At the threshing floor, Mears instructed his assistants to fetch water and then divided the area into sections, watering each one. Due to the dry weather, the water evaporated quickly. But when water reached the spot where Bauer had previously stood, Mears shouted to stop and pointed at a patch of darker soil.

Galileo's beloved daughter Maria, a nun at the ancient monastery, lived a tranquil and devout life there. The monastery was nestled in a vast field, surrounded by lush trees, with rolling hills in the distance dotted with a few scattered cottages. However, it was in this seemingly peaceful place that a shocking murder occurred. Sister Sophia was found dead on the balcony of the bell tower, her right eye pierced by a poisoned needle that lay beside her body. The door beneath the bell tower was tightly closed and bolted, clearly indicating that the murderer could not have entered from there. The balcony was about 15 meters above the ground, with a wide river flowing slowly below, and the opposite bank about 50 meters away. It was said that the wind was very strong on the night of the incident, making it nearly impossible for the murderer to have shot the poisoned needle from across the river. The abbess considered it a suicide case, but as a devout believer, would Sophia really choose to end her life in such a way? Maria had her doubts and asked her father Galileo to come to the monastery to help investigate. Upon arrival, Galileo first observed the bell tower and its surroundings. He noted that the balcony was indeed out of range for the poisoned needle to be shot. Maria told him that Sophia was very interested in Galileo's theory of Earth's motion and had secretly read his \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems.\" She speculated that Sophia might have gone to the bell tower that night to observe the stars and moon. Galileo inquired about the possibility of homicide or whether Sophia had any enemies. Maria revealed that Sophia came from a wealthy family and had a half-brother. This spring, after their father's death, Sophia planned to donate her inheritance to the monastery, but her half-brother strongly opposed it. The day before the incident, he had sent a package, which now had disappeared. After pondering for a moment, Galileo suggested searching the riverbed for a possible telescope. The next day, Maria hurried back home to tell Galileo that they had found a telescope at the bottom of the river, discovered by the gatekeeper while diving. However, Maria did not understand how this telescope was related to the murder. Galileo then explained his reasoning to his daughter.

The children excitedly chased each other around the grass, while Mrs. Dulles spread out a picnic blanket and prepared a delicious lunch.

On Monday morning, as usual, Jenny's mother drove her to school in her deep blue sedan. The school is located in the city center, surrounded by a busy commercial district and neatly arranged palm trees. However, when Jenny's mother returned to the school in the evening, she was informed that the child had been taken away by someone claiming to be a relative. Chaos ensued at home, and as the family frantically searched for Jenny, a man with a hoarse voice called, claiming to have Jenny and demanding a ransom of $500,000. For his daughter's safety, Bane followed the kidnapper's demands and went alone to the designated location to deliver the money. However, after receiving the ransom, the kidnappers did not release the hostage but demanded an equal amount again. Left with no choice, Bane called the police for help.\n\nAfter receiving the report, the police immediately formed a special task force led by Officer Brown, an experienced and calm detective known for his exceptional reasoning and command abilities in major cases. Determined to bring the criminals to justice, Officer Brown mobilized a large police force to conduct a thorough search throughout the city. After days of relentless effort, they found Jenny in a long-abandoned warehouse in the suburbs, weak but unharmed. Although she was frightened, Jenny clearly remembered that there were two middle-aged men who decided to escape to sea with the ransom after hearing about the citywide police search.\n\nUpon receiving this information, Officer Brown immediately led his officers to the seaside and called for helicopter reinforcement. By the time they arrived at the shore, the two kidnappers had already left the harbor by boat. Officer Brown and two other officers jumped onto a motorboat and gave chase at full speed. As evening fell and the sunset cast golden glimmers on the sea, visibility became blurred. The reinforcing helicopter arrived, and Officer Brown boarded it to take command from the air.

The killer smirked, raised his semi-automatic pistol, and fired three bullets through the gap at Akasaka to his right, hitting his mark without fail. The gunshots coincided with the train's whistle. The killer looked at his weapon with a sneaky delight, thinking, \"Heh, my gun has a silencer, and I timed it perfectly with the train's whistle. I've taken out that bastard Akasaka without anyone being the wiser!\" He then swiftly left the scene. As Akasaka fell to the ground, by the time Akita realized what had happened and looked around, the train had already departed, leaving no one on the platform. Officer Okamura, who rushed to the scene, checked all the tickets sold; none were for Kumagaya, nor had anyone disembarked there. Who could the killer be? With no leads, Okamura had no choice but to visit Detective Kiyohiko Asami's residence overnight. After recounting the case, Okamura shook his head in frustration and said, \"It seems we might be dealing with a psychopath who secretly got off at that small station, killed someone he had never met before, and then slipped back onto the train. But we'll never be able to catch him! Think about it, the killer timed it perfectly, and his target was random; he's like a ghost killer!\" Asami smiled slightly and confidently said, \"In my opinion, there won't be more than 12 suspects to investigate.\" Do you know why Asami would say that?", "options": ["The killer is a passenger on the train.", "The killer is a train attendant.", "The killer is a station staff member.", "The killer is a passing traveler."], "answer": 1, "clue_graph": {"evidence": "The killer was able to get on and off the train within 2 minutes -> The killer might be a train attendant.\nThe killer knew the timing of the train's whistle -> The killer might be a train attendant.\nThe killer could identify his target just by seeing their shoes or hearing their voice -> The killer might be a train attendant.", "multi_hop_reasoning": "After correlating the clues:\nThe killer might be a train attendant + There are no more than 12 attendants on a train -> There won't be more than 12 suspects to investigate.\nThere won't be more than 12 suspects to investigate + The investigation among the 12 attendants on the train led to finding the killer -> The killer is confirmed to be a train attendant."}, "question": "Hikaru Kajiyama believes that the number of suspects requiring investigation will not exceed twelve."}

After last night's spring rain, the air was filled with the fresh scent of soil and plants, and the willow trees lining the streets appeared even greener. There were few pedestrians on the street, only a handful of early-rising vendors setting up their stalls. Madame Curie, wearing her signature grey coat and a light purple scarf, enjoyed the tranquility of the morning. However, as she was cycling halfway to her destination, an unexpected incident occurred. She found a police officer lying by the roadside with a stab wound in his abdomen, in critical condition. Madame Curie immediately stopped her bike and used her scarf to urgently bandage the wound. The weakened officer told her that just minutes ago, he was attacked by a suspicious young man while in pursuit, and the assailant had also stolen his police bicycle to flee the scene. After sharing this information, the officer pointed in the direction of the escapee and then lost consciousness. Madame Curie asked passing citizens to help look after the injured officer and immediately chased in the direction indicated by the policeman.\n\nBefore long, Madame Curie arrived at a crossroads. At this point, she had to make a choice: which direction had the culprit fled? She looked around and noticed that both paths were gently sloping upwards, and about 50 meters from the crossroads, both were covered with a layer of loose yellow sand. There was a clear set of bicycle tire tracks on the left path's sand, suggesting that the culprit might have escaped from there. However, confusingly, there were similar tire tracks on the right path as well. Madame Curie decided to carefully observe the tracks on both sides: the left path's tracks showed that the front wheel was shallower than the rear wheel; whereas on the right path, the depth of the front and rear wheel tracks were roughly the same.

{"id": 2841, "context": "On a rainy morning in Nevada, the courtroom was dimly lit, and the air was thick with tension and unease. Today, a premeditated murder case that had garnered widespread attention was to be tried. The defendant, Jones, a middle-aged man with a pale complexion, betrayed anxiety and fear in his eyes. He was accused of killing McCarthy, a locally well-known businessman, one month prior. Following the incident, the police and the prosecution conducted a thorough investigation and gathered a substantial amount of evidence against Jones. Despite this, McCarthy's body had not been found to date, which remained a mystery in the case.\n\nJones had hired a renowned lawyer to defend him. Known for his sharp insight and masterful defense skills, the lawyer enjoyed a prestigious reputation in the legal field. In the courtroom, dressed in a crisp suit, the lawyer began his defense calmly: \"Your Honor, members of the jury, today we are discussing a matter of life and death. The police have not yet found McCarthy's body. While it is possible for a murderer to hide or destroy the body, I ask you all, if it turns out that McCarthy is still alive, even appearing in this courtroom, would you still believe that my client killed McCarthy?\" A ripple of laughter spread through the courtroom, seemingly mocking the lawyer's wild imagination. \"What exactly are you trying to say?\" asked the judge. \"Just this,\" replied the lawyer as he walked out from behind the railing to the side door of the courtroom and said loudly, \"Now, please look at that door!\" With that, he opened the door... Everyone's gaze turned to the side door, but it was empty; there was no one there. The lawyer then spoke slowly: \"I am not fooling anyone. I merely conducted a small psychological test within the bounds of the law. The fact that everyone's attention shifted to that side door just now shows that everyone hoped McCarthy would appear there, which also proves that everyone harbors doubts about whether McCarthy has indeed been killed.\" After pausing for effect, he called out loudly: \"The 12 jurors present, can you really convict my client as McCarthy's killer based solely on evidence that even you doubt?\" The courtroom erupted into commotion.

{"id": 2842, "context": "After suffering a crushing defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the French Emperor Napoleon was exiled to the remote South Atlantic island of Saint Helena. The island was picturesque, yet for Napoleon, who once dominated Europe, it was a lonely prison. The weather on the island was unpredictable, with sunshine one moment and howling sea winds the next. Napoleon lived a secluded life on the island, accompanied only by a loyal servant named Santini. Santini was a man of average stature with neatly trimmed facial hair, and he took meticulous care of the fallen emperor with unwavering loyalty.\n\nOne day, feeling unwell, Napoleon sent Santini to find the island's governor, Lowe, to express his desire for a doctor. Santini traversed the island's winding paths to reach the governor's office. By noon, Santini had not returned. During this time, however, a young military officer hurried from the governor's office to inform Napoleon in a serious tone and uniform: \"Your servant has been arrested for theft.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Napoleon rushed to the governor's office, hoping to uncover the truth. Governor Lowe was a middle-aged man with grey hair and deep-set eyes. He explained to Napoleon what had happened: \"When Santini came to see me, I was busy with gold coins brought by the islanders. Since I needed to concentrate on these coins, I asked my secretary to take him to the room on the left to rest. Later, I put the coins in a drawer and locked it before going to the restroom. When I returned, I realized I had left the key on the desk, and upon checking, found that ten coins were missing from the drawer. During this time, Santini was waiting in the room on the left, and my forgotten key was on the desk—who else but him could have stolen them?\" Governor Lowe's voice carried a hint of certainty.\n\nNapoleon did not respond immediately but instead approached the door on the left and peered through its frosted glass. He could vaguely see something at the entrance but nothing beyond that. He touched the frosted glass and found that the side facing inward was smooth, while the side facing the governor's office was rough. The secretary's office on the right side of the governor's office had frosted glass with the opposite texture. Napoleon turned around and pointed at the frosted glass on the door, saying to Lowe: \"Come and see for yourself; it is impossible for Santini to see clearly into your room through this frosted glass.

Due to the need for an annual inventory and maintenance, the store decided to close for three days. The staff took advantage of this rare holiday to do things they enjoyed, some went hiking to breathe fresh air, while others went to the beach to enjoy the sun and sand. During these three days, the city experienced a spring rain, making the air exceptionally fresh.\n\nOn the fourth day, when the jewelry store just reopened, the sky was still overcast, but it did not affect customers' pursuit of precious jewelry.

Officer Wade said that if it was a habitual criminal, his fingerprints should be on file. Waller worriedly mentioned that he saw the man put on gloves after putting down the watch. Officer Wade asked which watches had been touched, and Waller said there were over 100 watches in the cabinet and customers would fiddle with them; it was hard to say for sure. However, Officer Wade did not seem to think it would be difficult to find clues. He picked up a watch with tweezers and confirmed that this was the watch touched by the thief.

Pete had a deep bond with his daughter, and they often attended various charity events together, where her smile always shone brightly. However, on a sunny and breezy afternoon, his daughter did not return home from school on time. Pete, frantic with worry, searched everywhere until he received a call from the kidnapper demanding a ransom of 6 million dollars. The kidnapper instructed over the phone: \"Wrap the money in cloth, put it in a suitcase. At 9:30 tonight, leave it under the chair next to the Statue of Liberty.\" To save his beloved daughter's life, Pete decided to comply with the kidnapper's demands and pleaded with the police not to alarm the kidnapper to avoid harming his daughter. Although the police agreed to Pete's request, they secretly deployed officers to ambush near the Statue of Liberty.\n\nAt 9:30 p.m., with a few thin clouds drifting in the sky and the moonlight casting a solemn glow on the Statue of Liberty, a young woman arrived. She was dressed simply and quickly left after retrieving the suitcase from under the chair. After walking a distance, she hailed a taxi, and the undercover police cars immediately began to follow her. The taxi stopped in front of a subway station, where the woman got out with the suitcase and two detectives followed her. She stored the suitcase in a locker and then went to the platform empty-handed. One detective stayed to watch the suitcase while the other continued to follow her. Unfortunately, just as she jumped onto a train that had just arrived at the platform, the doors closed behind her. Although she escaped, the suitcase remained, and her accomplice would surely come for it. With this in mind, the detectives kept a close watch on the suitcase.

The guard, Keiko, a middle-aged woman who always wore reading glasses, hurriedly reported the situation to Officer Aoki. Officer Aoki, a seasoned veteran, immediately rushed to investigate at the women's prison cell number 108. The iron door of the cell was wide open, and a key filed from an old piece of iron was inserted into the lock on the ground. Clearly, Noriko Endo had used this key to make her escape. Officer Aoki recalled that when he had transferred the prisoner to the jail the day before, he had specifically instructed Keiko to thoroughly search Noriko Endo to ensure she did not smuggle in any items. Keiko had assured him that she had even checked the underwear and nothing was missed. However, Noriko Endo could not have known in advance that she would be detained in cell number 108, so it was impossible for her to have prepared the corresponding key beforehand. Officer Aoki asked Keiko if anyone had contact with Noriko Endo during her shift. Keiko remembered that no one had direct contact with Noriko Endo, except for last night when Monk Edano from Fukujuan Temple visited. Monk Edano, an elderly monk in his fifties, claimed that Noriko Endo was once a female devotee at the temple and had donated to the temple's renovation projects. After learning of her crime and imprisonment, he specially brought a bowl of noodles to comfort her. Keiko carefully inspected the noodles and found no unusual items, so she delivered the noodles to Noriko Endo. After the noodles were eaten, Keiko personally took the empty bowl back to Monk Edano, so he had no chance to meet Noriko Endo alone or pass her a key. But shortly after Keiko returned from the restroom, Noriko Endo mysteriously disappeared. Officer Aoki concluded that this was due to Keiko's negligence for not thoroughly checking the bowl of noodles.

Founded by the renowned detective Jones, known for his sharp insight and exceptional deductive skills, the agency had a prestigious reputation in the industry. As soon as the gentleman stepped in, he urgently conveyed his fears to Jones: someone was plotting to assassinate him, and he requested protection.

{"id": 2900, "context": "On a bright and sunny morning, Wood received an anxious phone call from Mrs. Locke. Her voice trembled noticeably as she inquired whether her husband, Mr. Locke, was with Wood. Surprised, Wood explained that he hadn't seen his old friend for a month. Mrs. Locke continued, saying her husband had been missing for several days and that she had contacted all their friends and relatives who might know his whereabouts, to no avail. Wood immediately set aside what he was doing and rushed to the Locke residence, hoping to help Mrs. Locke find some clues.\n\nUpon arriving at the Locke home, Wood found Mrs. Locke sitting on the living room sofa, looking distraught. She told Wood that there had been no quarrel between her and Mr. Locke, and that he seemed even more excited and lively than usual the day before he disappeared. However, he soon returned to his usual calm demeanor. Mrs. Locke was clueless about why her husband would suddenly vanish and hadn't heard of any recent troubles he might have faced.\n\nWood recalled being invited to a party at the Locke's a month earlier. He noticed that Mr. Locke was unusually excited, though not for reasons like winning the lottery, a promotion, or a raise. At the party, Mr. Locke borrowed a sum of money from Wood, mysteriously stating it was of great importance to him and promising to repay it twofold in the future. During their conversation, Mr. Locke showed Wood two letters signed by Weber—a wealthy magnate from the East. The letters revealed Weber's displeasure with some form of extortion but his willingness to discuss it with Mr. Locke at a meeting in San Francisco in a few days. The second letter confirmed Weber's arrival in San Francisco on July 15th, staying at the Garden Hotel.\n\nWood suddenly remembered that before Weber became famous, he and Mr. Locke had worked together in the same mine. A murder had occurred there, with Weber as the prime suspect, but Mr. Locke had provided an alibi for him. This incident had long been forgotten by Wood. However, the day Mr. Locke disappeared was precisely July 15th—could it be that Mr. Locke went to meet Weber? Wood checked the newspaper and indeed saw a front-page story about \"Mr. Weber's arrival in San Francisco for a conference.\"\n\nWood suggested that Mrs. Locke wait a few more days before considering reporting her husband missing to the police. However, after several days passed with the conference over and Weber returned East, there was still no word from Mr. Locke. With no other choice, Wood and Mrs. Locke decided to contact the authorities. Two weeks later, police discovered an unidentifiable body at an abandoned construction site on the outskirts of San Francisco. Despite the body's advanced state of decomposition, Mrs. Locke recognized some personal items as belonging to her missing husband.\n\nThe medical examiner estimated the body had been dead for at least ten days, with strangulation as the cause of death. Based on the evidence gathered, the police brought charges against Weber. In court, Weber appeared completely innocent, claiming he knew nothing of the matter and had never heard of Mr. Locke. When the court presented the two letters as key evidence, Weber denied they were written in his handwriting. A handwriting analysis confirmed that the letters were not authored by Weber.\n\nThe case took a turn on the second day after adjournment when a witness appeared in court—a waiter from the Hyatt Hotel claimed to have served a man resembling Mr. Locke on July 21st. The man looked down-and-out, ordered cheap dishes, ate hurriedly, left behind a wallet containing many bills addressed to Mr. Locke. Wood immediately recognized them as Mr. Locke's belongings. This discovery was puzzling: if Mr. Locke was alive at that time and Weber had already returned East, then who was the real murderer? Given Weber's status and background, it seemed unlikely he had ever been to San Francisco before or could have hired a hitman.

Suddenly, a man dressed in black caught Brown's attention. The man wore sunglasses even at night and carried a black leather bag, walking briskly forward. Officer Brown found his behavior suspicious and decided to follow him. The man in black crossed the busy streets and turned into a quiet alley, eventually entering an unassuming restaurant. Brown noticed that unlike other customers, the man didn't go to the counter to order but went straight into the restroom and closed the door behind him. Brown lit a cigarette outside the door, found a corner to sit in, and kept a covert watch on the restroom door. As time ticked by without any sign of movement from the restroom, Brown began to suspect that the man might have become aware of his presence or had escaped through some means. Deciding to act, he quickly drew his gun and knocked on the door. When there was no response, he forced the door open only to be shocked by what he saw: a body lay in a pool of blood, with the black clothing, sunglasses, and leather bag tossed aside carelessly.

According to our analysis, Mr. Ward has been dead for at least eight days.\" \"Is there carpet in the room?\" \"Yes, it extends to an inch from the corner of the wall.\" \"Are there any bloodstains on the carpet or windowsill?\" \"No, there's nothing but dust. Only the bed has bloodstains.\" \"In that case, you'd better have someone check the bloodstains on the carpet,\" Simpson said, \"Someone must have had a key to open the door and shot Mr. Ward while he was standing by the window.

{"id": 2920, "context": "On a sweltering summer afternoon, the streets of downtown Vienna were sparsely populated as everyone sought refuge from the heat indoors. However, inside the Vienna Police Department, there was a flurry of activity. A middle-aged woman rushed in, her voice trembling as she reported her husband's disappearance. She explained that a week earlier, on a sunny morning, her husband and his friend Adam had planned a several-day trip along the Danube River. The police quickly initiated an investigation and located Adam. He recalled that during their journey along the winding Danube, the sky was occasionally dotted with white clouds and a gentle breeze was in the air, with everything seeming very peaceful. Three days prior, they had checked into a picturesque inn, and that very night, his friend told him he had some personal matters to attend to and never returned. As for where he went, Adam claimed to have no knowledge. The inn confirmed that Adam had checked out the previous day, but his roommate had not completed the check-out process.\n\nThe police immediately deployed a large number of officers to search every corner of the city for the missing person, but for several days there were no leads. The police began to suspect that the missing person might have met with foul play and decided to expand the search area. They dispatched helicopters for aerial reconnaissance in nearby forests and used motorboats to search upstream and downstream on the Danube River, hoping to find the missing person or his remains. Despite the significant resources invested by the police, they came up empty-handed. All signs pointed to the possibility that the missing person had been murdered and abandoned in a remote location.\n\nJust as the police were at an impasse, a biologist named Denzel volunteered to help. After several days of intense investigation and analysis, Denzel provided the police with a crucial piece of information: the missing person might be buried in a swamp in a remote forest south of Vienna. Following this lead, the police conducted a search and eventually found a male body in a swamp. A forensic examination confirmed that the deceased was indeed the missing middle-aged man. There were clear strangulation marks on his neck, indicating that he had been strangled to death.\n\nThe interrogation began, and an officer sternly questioned Adam: \"Someone has accused you of luring your friend to the forest south of Vienna and killing him there. Confess your crime now!\" Adam responded vehemently: \"This is a setup! Why do you suspect me? Bring the witness to confront me!\" At this point, the biologist pointed to a glass jar on the table containing pollen that served as key evidence. Why could pollen be such compelling evidence against Adam?", "options": ["Adam's leather shoes were found to have unique pollen that is specific to the swampy area south of Vienna.", "Adam displayed extreme nervousness during the interrogation, which suggests his guilt.", "There was a financial dispute between Adam and the missing person, which could be a motive for the crime.", "Adam had mentioned several times his desire to explore the southern part of Vienna."], "answer": 0, "clue_graph": {"evidence": "Traveling together -> Adam becomes a suspect\nUnique pollen on Adam's shoes -> Adam has been to where the body was found\nBody found in forest south of Vienna -> Body discarded in a remote area", "multi_hop_reasoning": "Connecting these clues leads to:\nAdam becomes a suspect + Adam has been to where the body was found -> Adam could be the murderer\nAdam could be the murderer + Body discarded in a remote area -> Adam is likely the murderer\nAdam is likely the murderer + Adam denies crime -> Pollen is evidence against Adam\nPollen is evidence against Adam -> Pollen can prove Adam is the murderer"}, "question": "How does pollen become compelling evidence in the case against Adam?"}

He claimed that he had just received a threatening phone call demanding that he hand over a top-secret document on submarine technology, or his life would be in danger. The doctor requested Detective Hawk to visit his suburban villa at 7 p.m. to discuss the matter in detail. Detective Hawk agreed to his request and immediately set out.\n\nAt 7 p.m., Detective Hawk drove through the winding mountain roads to Dr. Simpson's villa, perched on the hillside overlooking a lake. The villa had an antique and elegant exterior, surrounded by various flowers and plants. The detective rang the doorbell, but there was no response from inside. He tried pushing the door open and found it unlocked. Upon entering, he discovered Dr. Simpson lying under the sofa, with a handkerchief smelling of anesthetic scattered nearby. The doctor slowly opened his eyes, still in a semi-conscious state, instinctively touched his pocket, and suddenly exclaimed, \"It's gone, the documents have been stolen!\" Detective Hawk quickly asked, \"Who did it? When?\" The doctor glanced at his watch and recalled, \"About 30 minutes ago, I was watching the TV program 'Ocean Mysteries' while enjoying my favorite Red Fuji apple.

That evening, with not a cloud in the sky and moonlight spilling onto the quiet streets, occasionally disrupted by a passing car, the store's owner, after a busy day, contentedly locked up and prepared to head home. Little did he know, a theft was quietly brewing on this peaceful night. Thieves shattered the glass window of the store's back door, sneaked inside, pried open three cash boxes, stole ten thousand pounds in cash, and took a trumpet worth twenty thousand pounds from the display case, cleverly concealing it in an ordinary trumpet case to carry away.\n\nThe next morning, the owner was speechless with shock upon discovering the scene. The police quickly got involved and soon deduced that the crime was an inside job. Officer Valach, a detective with rich experience and insight, took over the case. After carefully examining the scene, he narrowed the suspects down to three apprentice boys: Kevin, Hanson, and Roger. All three had interned at the music store and knew it inside out.\n\nOfficer Valach decided to take an unconventional approach to uncover the real culprit. He had the three boys sit in his office with three pens and papers on the table. He said to them, \"I've asked you here to help me find the real thief by working together.

Kevin read reluctantly: \"On Saturday morning, I scoped out the music store and saw that the backyard was the easiest place to strike. So at night, I broke the window to get in, took the cash and a valuable trumpet, then slipped out of the store.\" Hanson said: \"I would cut a big hole in the display window with a knife so no one would suspect me. I wouldn't pry open three cash boxes because that would make noise. Instead, I'd take a trumpet and hide it in a box.\" Finally, Roger said: \"At night, I'd pry open the store door, wear gloves to steal cash and the trumpet from the display window.

In desperation, he entertained a terrible thought—murder to silence his creditor. Jones meticulously planned a gathering to invite Sieg over for drinks at his home and secretly slipped sleeping pills into the wine. Soon after drinking, Sieg fell into a deep slumber. Seizing the opportunity, Jones tied Sieg up with a rope and submerged his head in a bucket of water he had prepared earlier, causing him to suffocate to death. Afterwards, to create an alibi, Jones hurried to a nearby bar where he spent two hours drinking and chatting with strangers to ensure he had proof of his absence. Two hours later, he returned home, transported Sieg's body to the seaside, unzipped Sieg's pants, and pushed the body off a cliff into the turbulent sea.

However, these paintings also brought him considerable trouble, especially in terms of maintenance and security.

At 1 a.m., the police received an urgent call from a man with an anxious and hoarse voice, claiming his wife had been murdered. Officer Brown immediately led his team to the reported location, a seemingly ordinary house that concealed a tragic family residence. The police car splashed through the rain. Upon arrival, Officer Brown stepped out of the car and heard a burst of frantic barking. He crossed the wet lawn and saw a sheepdog chained to the front door, its fur soaked by the rain. Then, a middle-aged man came out of the house; he was the caller, Mr. Brogan. He softly called out, \"Teddy, quiet down!\" and the sheepdog obediently sat at his feet, appearing very well-behaved. Brogan, with a look of sorrow and anxiety, led the officer inside. The victim was in her pajamas, lying on the kitchen floor with a fatal blow to her head. Brogan recounted the events to the officer: \"I had an argument with my wife about our child's education earlier in the evening and stormed out in anger. I wandered around for two hours and when I calmed down and returned home, I found my wife lying in a pool of blood around 11 p.m.\" He speculated that a burglar might have broken in and killed his wife upon being discovered. \"Was anything stolen?\" Officer Brown asked. \"The cash in the wardrobe and my wife's jewelry are missing,\" Brogan replied. Officer Brown then asked, \"Did you take your dog with you when you went out?\" \"No, I went alone.\" After the crime scene investigation was mostly concluded, Officer Brown visited the neighbors the next morning to gather information. One neighbor, a student preparing for entrance exams, had been up all night studying and did not sleep.

The interior of the company building was luxuriously decorated, with a spacious and bright lobby adorned with various pieces of art. Ethan took the elevator to the 9th floor, pushed open the door to Valentin's office, only to find Valentin hanging from a beam, long dead.

He owned a jewelry store filled with all kinds of precious ornaments, each shimmering with an enchanting light. Recently, Yuerus acquired a diamond necklace of immense value. Each diamond on the necklace was carefully selected, and the entire piece sparkled under the light as if a galaxy had descended to earth. To protect this treasured item, Yuerus placed it in an exquisitely crafted metal jewelry box, secured it with an unbreakable lock, and sealed it with a tamper-evident seal. He would not easily show this necklace to anyone except trusted friends or those with a deep understanding of jewelry.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon, three well-dressed and elegant merchants visited: Annievsky, Bertes, and Yunifis, all regular customers of Yuerus's jewelry store. Yuerus warmly welcomed them and showed them his private collection, including the astonishing diamond necklace. The merchants were full of praise for the necklace, and after viewing it, Yuerus resealed the jewelry box with a new seal.\n\nThey then proceeded to the living room, adorned with exquisite paintings and antique furniture, for a pleasant conversation. The room was filled with the faint scent of tea, and through the window, one could see flowers in the garden swaying gently in the breeze. However, during the conversation, Yuerus noticed something odd: all three merchants had injuries on their fingers. Annievsky's index finger was treated with purple medicine for inflammation; Bertes' thumb had been bitten by a poisonous insect and was treated with iodine; Yunifis had a cut on his thumb, treated with red medicine.

He believed that the second gang of thieves was still on the train and quickly gave instructions to the transit police in a low voice.\n\nJust then, an announcement over the train's PA system declared that a passenger in carriage number 9 had suddenly fallen seriously ill and required urgent medical attention.

When the detective turned around, he saw the man's handbag fall to the ground, but the man quickly picked it up and ran into an old building ahead. Due to the dim light, Niedas couldn't make out the man's face clearly but vaguely remembered that he wore sunglasses and had a bit of a beard on his chin. At that moment, another panting person arrived; he was a taxi driver who urgently asked, \"Did you see a man run past here? He's a robber who stole my entire day's earnings!\" Niedas immediately offered to help and entered the building with the driver. The building seemed dark inside, with the windows of the first-floor warehouse tightly shut and only the adjacent staircase leading to the second floor. There were two rooms on the second floor, and it appeared there were no other escape routes. Therefore, the robber must be hiding in one of the rooms. The door of the first room had \"Moncy\" written on it. Niedas knocked on the door, and a young man's face appeared when it opened. Although he seemed calm, Niedas insisted on checking inside. The driver immediately spotted the handbag on the floor of the room and exclaimed with joy, \"That's the bag!\" Upon opening it, they found dirty sweaters, canned beer, instant noodles, and miscellaneous documents and books. Moncy took out a can of beer and as he opened it, foam sprayed out, splashing onto his face. Seemingly annoyed, he questioned, \"Why do you only suspect me? Doesn't the man next door have any suspicion? A poor painter named Rons lives next door.\" Niedas then knocked on Rons's door. Rons was very irritable for being disturbed from his sleep. After learning why they were there, he explained, \"I went to bed four hours ago.\" Upon entering Rons's room, Niedas and the driver found a handbag under the bed containing only painting supplies and a few cans of drinks. Rons took out a drink and started drinking it himself, sarcastically saying, \"Thanks to you, I'm now fully awake.\" Niedas noticed two apple slices on the table that had been peeled and cored. He asked suspiciously, \"When were these apples peeled, and why haven't they discolored?\" Rons replied, \"I peeled them before I went to sleep. If you're suspicious, taste one yourself.\" After tasting an apple slice, Niedas thought for a moment and then told the driver, \"I already know who the robber is.\" Based on the description above, who is the robber?", "options": ["Moncy's handbag contained items that were stolen.", "Rons showed irritation due to being woken from sleep.", "The foam from Moncy's canned beer indicates it had been shaken violently.", "The fact that Rons's apples hadn't discolored suggests they were soaked in saltwater."], "answer": 2, "clue_graph": {"evidence": "\"The foam from Moncy's canned beer -> The beer can was shaken violently.\"\n\"Rons's apples hadn't discolored, and Niedas tasted saltiness -> The apples were soaked in saltwater.\"\nLinking these clues together we get:\n\"The beer can was shaken violently + Moncy's handbag -> Moncy is the robber.\"\n\"The apples were soaked in saltwater + Rons went to bed four hours ago -> Rons is not the robber.\"\n\"Moncy is the robber + Rons is not the robber -> The robber is Moncy.\"", "multi_hop_reasoning": "From the clues given in the problem:\n\"The foam from Moncy's canned beer -> The beer can was shaken violently.\"\n\"Rons's apples hadn't discolored, and Niedas tasted saltiness -> The apples were soaked in saltwater.\"\nLinking these clues together we get:\n\"The beer can was shaken violently + Moncy's handbag -> Moncy is the robber.\"\n\"The apples were soaked in saltwater + Rons went to bed four hours ago -> Rons is not the robber.\"\n\"Moncy is the robber + Rons is not the robber -> The robber is Moncy.\""}, "question": "Who is the robber?"}

On a sunny afternoon, Hague rushed to the insurance company to file a claim, alleging that all the oil paintings in his home had been plundered by robbers the previous night. He provided detailed proof and demanded compensation from the insurance company. Given the large amount of the claim, the insurance company grew suspicious and decided to hire the renowned detective Mason to investigate.\n\nMason and his assistant arrived at Hague's spacious and luxurious residence on a drizzly morning. The interior was elegantly decorated, but the bare hooks on the walls stood out conspicuously. Hague invited them to sit on an exquisite French sofa and then called his servant to recount the robbery in his stead. The servant, a gaunt middle-aged man with a haggard face, narrated with a trembling voice: \"That night, as my master and I were discussing a newly acquired Renaissance painting, several masked robbers burst in.

After they took all the paintings, they knocked me out with the gun butt as well.\" Mason turned to Mr. Hague: \"Is this account accurate?\" Hague firmly responded: \"Certainly, the scars on our heads are proof.\" The assistant checked both their heads and found newly healed wounds.

Its white exterior walls glisten in the sunlight, facing the sparkling sea. Elliot's house is equipped with large windows both in the front and back, and whenever he needs to ponder, he gazes out at the boundless sea. Not long ago, during a chance visit to the university library, Elliot stumbled upon a precious manuscript left behind by a French mathematician from 300 years ago. This manuscript is of immense value to Elliot, and he considers it one of the most important discoveries of his research career.\n\nThis morning, after studying a portion of the manuscript, Elliot, overwhelmed with excitement and fatigue, did not put it away but left it on his desk. At that time, the window in front of the desk was open, with bright sunshine and a gentle sea breeze coming through. Suddenly, a strong wind arose from the sea, blowing open another window opposite to the first one, and the gust swept up a sheet of the manuscript and carried it out of the window, drifting towards the sea. Elliot did not witness this event himself; it was his loyal assistant who informed him.\n\nAn hour after the wind had subsided, Mr. Ross, a friend of Elliot's who loves nature and outdoor activities, came to visit. Upon hearing about Elliot's loss of the manuscript, he suggested that they take a walk on the golden sandy beach in front of the house. While strolling on the beach, Elliot shared with Ross the incident that he deeply regretted. After listening, Ross did not immediately comfort Elliot but instead carefully observed the footprints left by a seagull on the beach. Judging from the footprints, the seagull had flown towards the sea, and considering that the footprints were not erased by the receding tide, it indicated that the seagull had taken flight less than an hour ago. Ross asked, \"Did you see with your own eyes the manuscript being blown out of the window?\" Elliot shook his head and said, \"No, it was my assistant who told me.

Captain Qin's yard was filled with various flowers and plants, and the air was suffused with a faint floral scent. Captain Qin treated him to a big bowl of fragrant pork chop rice, which Zhao Xiaojun savored contentedly, feeling as if all his troubles had been carried away by the wind. Captain Qin shook his head helplessly, knowing that Zhao Xiaojun had been living frugally lately, but their friendship went far beyond material assistance. \"There haven't been any major cases these past few days. A few days ago, an officer with a name very similar to mine cracked a gun case, and the media made a big fuss about it, which is really unfair. Why didn't anyone come to interview me when I solved that underage prostitution case?\" Zhao Xiaojun said while licking the rice grains from his bowl. As they chatted, a sudden thunderstorm drove away the pedestrians on the street. Soon after, the rain stopped, the wind ceased, and a beautiful rainbow appeared in the clear sky! \"Wow! What a beautiful rainbow!\" Captain Qin exclaimed with a smile as he opened the window. He had a perfect view of the east-west thoroughfare right in front of him where the rainbow was fully visible. \"Speaking of rainbows... I remember there's a seafood restaurant in Keelung that has really good red fish...\" Zhao Xiaojun mentioned while picking his teeth with a toothpick. Just then, a nearby jewelry store was suddenly raided by several thugs who stole many gold rings and dozens of gold necklaces. Captain Qin rushed to the scene, thoroughly investigated the features and appearance of the criminals, and ordered a comprehensive search for the recently escaped thugs. Half a day later, three suspects matching the description were apprehended. The first one said anxiously, \"Robbery? When did that happen? 5:30 PM?

Suddenly, the tranquility of the afternoon was shattered by the urgent sound of a drum; a young peasant woman named Mrs. Liu was beating the drum to appeal for justice. Dressed plainly and looking haggard, she tearfully told her story in the public hall: \"My in-laws passed away long ago, and my husband is often away on business, leaving only my sister-in-law and me at home. Last night, I went to a neighbor's house to help with milling, while my sister-in-law stayed home to mend clothes. As night fell, dogs barked throughout the village, but our old yellow dog was unusually quiet. When I returned home and entered the door, I heard my sister-in-law screaming for help. I rushed inside and bumped into a man at the doorway, and we began to fight. In the darkness, I managed to scratch him several times, but lacking strength, I let him escape. When I lit a lamp inside the house, I found my poor sister-in-law with a pair of scissors stabbed into her chest; she had already stopped breathing.\" Wang Zhihuan asked, \"Did you see what that man looked like?\" Mrs. Liu replied, \"It was too dark to see his face clearly; I only know he was tall and well-built, with his upper body bare.\" \"Was there anyone else in your yard at that time?\" Wang Zhihuan continued to inquire. \"No, just an old yellow dog,\" Mrs. Liu answered. \"Is the yellow dog yours?\" \"We've had it for many years.\" \"When you came home last night, didn't you hear the dog bark?\" \"No.\" \"Alright, you may step down for now.\" That afternoon, Wang Zhihuan ordered his subordinates to post notices in all the villages. The people crowded around the notices, which stated that the county official would hold a trial for the yellow dog at the City God Temple the next day. The following day, curious onlookers swarmed in, packing the temple to capacity. Once enough people had arrived, Wang Zhihuan commanded his subordinates to close the temple doors and then expelled all children, women, and elderly men from the temple. Only a hundred or so young and strong men remained inside. Wang Zhihuan ordered these men to take off their shirts and stand facing the wall in a line.

The crime scene was dim and silent, with only a few faint streetlights casting light inside. The security guard was a long-standing employee of the company, known for his integrity and beloved by his colleagues. The police speculated that the tragedy was likely caused by a burglar who had infiltrated the building and, upon being discovered by the guard, committed murder to silence him before fleeing. After the incident, the police quickly intervened in the investigation and locked onto a suspect by evening—a single man living in the suburbs.\n\nDespite the nightfall and fatigue, detectives immediately rushed to the suspect's home for a surprise interrogation. \"Where were you at around 3:30 a.m. today?\" the detective asked sternly. The suspect appeared calm: \"I was already up at that time, in my yard using a disposable camera to document the blooming process of my morning glory flowers, taking a picture every four minutes.\" He pointed to a corner of the yard where the morning glories were in full bloom: \"These morning glories usually start to bloom around 3:10 a.m., and it takes about 40 minutes for all of them to fully open. I was taking pictures the whole time.\" The detectives compared the photos provided with the morning glories in the yard and indeed found that the flowers in the photos matched those at the scene.\n\nTo further verify the suspect's alibi, the police sent the photos to a botanical research institute, asking experts to determine the exact blooming time of the morning glories. The experts soon concluded that in mid-August, the region's morning glories start blooming as early as 2 a.m., usually beginning to unfold their petals around 3 a.m., and finishing blooming by around 4 a.m. It seemed that the suspect's alibi could hold up.

On this significant day, Tom was summoned to testify as a key witness in an assault case. Tom, a middle-aged man with thinning hair and wrinkles at the corners of his eyes, wore an ill-fitting gray suit and clutched an old hat in his hand. It was said that Tom had once been an excellent accountant who resigned after an unfortunate incident and had since become reclusive. His testimony was highly detrimental to the defendant, but before he could testify, he had to withstand cross-examination by the defense attorney. The judge and jury would decide based on the cross-examination whether he was qualified to serve as a witness for the prosecution.

I remember things from twenty or thirty years ago very clearly, as if they happened yesterday.\" The lawyer persisted, \"Do you have a smoking habit?\" Tom responded, \"Yes, but I don't smoke much.\" \"What brands do you usually smoke?\" \"Chesterfield and Marlboro.\" \"Do you also smoke Camel cigarettes?\" \"I used to smoke them in the past but not recently.\" \"Then can you tell me if the man leading the camel on the Camel cigarette box is wearing a turban?\" Tom furrowed his brow and pondered for a moment, searching his memory for the answer. He recalled images of camels being ridden through the desert and associated them with Arabs who often wear turbans. Without hesitation, he answered, \"Of course, the man leading the camel is wearing a turban.\" The lawyer revealed a sly smile on his face and pulled out a pack of Camel cigarettes from his pocket, holding it high in front of the jury.

Inspector Kogure asked with a serious expression, \"Hey, Inspector, what brings you here?\" \"That red sports car in the parking lot over there is yours, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, then you're in for some bad luck. As an important witness, you need to come with me to the police station.\" Inspector Kogure's unexpected words took Detective Tuan by surprise. \"What on earth did I do?\" \"Around 10 o'clock last night, someone attempted to break into the Solar Energy Research Institute. They were discovered by security personnel and fled over the wall, escaping in a red sports car parked on the vacant lot outside.\" \"Are you saying that car was mine?\" \"Yes, there were tire marks left on the lot. Just now, the forensics team examined your car, and the tire marks match those at the scene perfectly. Even tires of the same make have their own unique wear and damage characteristics, so tire marks are as decisive evidence as footprints.\" Hearing this from Inspector Kogure, Detective Tuan was even more astonished. \"But Inspector, I have an alibi. Around 9 o'clock last night, I went to visit Mr. Kuroda, a mystery writer, at Apartment A. We talked for two and a half hours, and I didn't leave his place until about 11:20 PM.\" \"Where was your car during this time?\" \"It was parked in the parking lot of Apartment A, locked up tight.\" \"So you're suggesting the criminal used a spare key to steal your car. It's an hour's drive from Apartment A to the Solar Energy Research Institute; there's enough time for a round trip.\" \"No, that's impossible. I have a habit of checking the odometer whenever I park my car, and last night the numbers hadn't changed at all.

{"id": 3839, "context": "On a beautiful spring morning, with the sun shining through the gaps in the leaves of a banyan tree at the entrance of the village, birds chirping and flowers blooming, a young man from the village named Xiao Zhang, known for his hard work and kindness, had saved up some money after years of toil. He planned to travel to a distant city to learn new skills, hoping to bring greater prosperity to his village upon his return. On the eve of his departure, he entrusted his savings to an old man in the village who claimed to be honest and trustworthy. This old man, known as Old Li, made his living selling herbal medicine and boasted of his exceptional memory and integrity. Two months later, as spring turned to summer, Xiao Zhang returned home, eager to apply his newfound knowledge and hopeful for the future. However, when he went to retrieve his money from Old Li, he was met with an unexpected situation. Old Li appeared confused and insisted that he had never kept Xiao Zhang's money. With no other choice, Xiao Zhang took the matter to the county court for a fair judgment.\n\nIn the grand hall of the county court, the magistrate sat elevated above, with an anxious Xiao Zhang and a bewildered Old Li standing before him. The magistrate asked Old Li if he had ever taken Xiao Zhang's money, to which Old Li tearfully denied. The magistrate then inquired if Xiao Zhang had any witnesses, and Xiao Zhang shook his head in resignation. The magistrate further asked, \"If what you say is true, do you remember where you gave the money to this old man?\" Xiao Zhang replied that it was under a large banyan tree. The magistrate then ordered Xiao Zhang to go to the banyan tree and tell it that it was going to be questioned. Although Xiao Zhang found this command unbelievable, he complied under the stern order of the magistrate. Meanwhile, Old Li secretly rejoiced at the side.\n\nAs time slowly passed during the wait, the magistrate suddenly asked Old Li, \"Old man, do you think that young man has reached the banyan tree by now?\" Old Li cleverly answered that he had not yet arrived. After some more time had passed, the magistrate asked again, \"Shouldn't that young man be on his way back now?\" Old Li confidently replied that he should be. Soon after, Xiao Zhang returned to the hall and dejectedly informed the magistrate that it was impossible for the banyan tree to come with him. The magistrate smiled and told Xiao Zhang that he now knew the truth and sternly ordered Old Li to return the money. Faced with the magistrate's pressing questions, Old Li finally admitted his lie.

The venue was lavishly decorated, with the scent of expensive perfume lingering in the air, and guests were dressed formally, their conversations ebbing and flowing. In such a high-end setting, the international thief Denilson took the opportunity to disguise himself and blend into the crowd, skillfully stealing two priceless large diamonds. He returned to his suburban villa home and immediately placed the diamonds in water to form ice cubes, storing them in the freezer. Since diamonds are transparent and colorless, hiding them inside ice cubes indeed makes them difficult to detect.\n\nThe next day, with the weather still unbearably hot, Detective Moore and his assistant arrived at Denilson's residence. They passed through the front yard decorated with various flowers and knocked on the villa's door. \"We have clearly seen you stealing the diamonds on the CCTV footage at the scene; you might as well hand them over,\" Detective Moore said while surveying the room's interior decor and Denilson's inadvertently revealed nervousness. \"If that's the case, then search as you please,\" Denilson replied nonchalantly.\n\n\"It's so hot today, how about a glass of iced cola?\" Detective Moore made a seemingly casual request. Denilson took ice cubes from the freezer, placed four in each glass, and then put the diamond-containing ice cube into his own glass before pouring cola and handing a glass to Detective Moore. He thought that even if the ice melted and the diamond was exposed, it would not be noticeable under the remaining half glass of cola.\n\nDetective Moore took a sip from his glass and subconsciously glanced at Denilson's glass. \"I'm sorry, I'd like to switch glasses with you,\" Detective Moore suddenly made a strange request. \"Mr. Moore, I find you quite rude. Do you think I poisoned your drink?\" Denilson stood up angrily, trying to divert Moore's attention. \"You misunderstand me, Mr. Denilson; I just want to taste what cola with a diamond is like,\" Detective Moore quickly snatched the glass from Denilson's hand.

The passengers aboard were either sunbathing on the deck, enjoying gourmet food in the restaurant, or resting in their cabins. However, amidst this tranquil and warm atmosphere, an unfortunate incident shattered the peace—Mrs. Char, dressed in black mourning clothes, hurriedly approached the captain with a pale face and exclaimed, \"It's terrible, the urn I brought with me has disappeared!\" Initially, the captain thought it was a misunderstanding, but when Mrs. Char revealed that the urn contained not only her father's ashes but also three invaluable diamonds, the situation took a serious turn.\n\nProfessor Colen, Mrs. Char's father, was a highly esteemed scholar who had been invited to teach at the University of Toronto in Canada before World War II. After the war broke out, he chose to stay in Canada due to his dissatisfaction with Hitler's fascist regime. As time passed, Professor Colen spent the rest of his life in this foreign land. This spring, the elderly professor fell gravely ill and, before passing away, entrusted his daughter to take his ashes back to Germany and to convert his savings into diamonds to be given to his three daughters in Germany. Mrs. Char recounted this past event to the captain with sorrow in her heart and mentioned that she had been carefully guarding the urn.\n\nThe captain immediately began an investigation and recorded the following details: Around 9 AM, Mrs. Char's friend Flora entered the cabin to chat with her; at 9:05 AM, the stewardess Anna came to tidy up the cabin, and the two continued their conversation on the deck. At 9:10 AM, when Mrs. Char returned to the cabin to fetch her camera, she found Anna rummaging through her bedside table. This led to an argument that lasted for 10 minutes. At 9:25 AM, Flora re-entered the cabin to invite Mrs. Char to admire the view from the deck but was turned down. After the stewardess left at 9:30 AM, the urn vanished without a trace...\n\nIf Mrs. Char's account is credible, then the thief must be either Anna or Flora. While the captain was in a dilemma, a crew member reported seeing a small purple-red wooden box bobbing on the river at the stern of the ship.
