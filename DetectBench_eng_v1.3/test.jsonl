However, upon reaching the shore, he discovered a small sailboat tilted on the sand. The boat looked old and worn but still retained signs of its past splendor. Curious, Xiao Wang approached the sailboat and called out loudly towards the cabin, but no one responded. His curiosity piqued, he climbed aboard using the anchor rope and peered into the dim cabin from the deck's staircase. There he saw a captain lying in a pool of blood with a short sword stabbed into his chest, apparently murdered. The captain's hand was tightly clutching a torn old nautical chart, and beside his bed stood an extinguished candle with its upper end melted horizontally. Convinced it was a murder case of great importance, Xiao Wang immediately reported it to the police. Upon arrival, the police began searching for clues. \"The boat likely docked here around noon yesterday, and even during the day, the cabin is very dark, so a candle would be needed to read the sea chart.

Xiao Ming took an old book of math puzzles off the shelf and turned to a problem about a fourth-order magic square. He explained that the puzzle required placing chess pieces numbered from 1 to 16 into the 16 squares of the game board in such a way that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and both diagonals was equal, and this sum (the magic constant) had to be 34.

It was on this gloomy night that the guard, Mark, discovered something amiss during his shift change at 10 p.m. As he entered Exhibition Hall 6, he noticed that an ancient Chinese painting and calligraphy had vanished, and the door to the hall was left open with a line written in ink at the doorway: \"Retrieve what is mine.\" Mark immediately called the police and informed Detective Rollins of the situation.

This was not a competition between typical athletes, but rather a thought experiment proposed by the famous mathematician Zenoâthe race between Achilles and the tortoise. It was said that this race would test Zeno's philosophical proposition that motion is impossible. The tortoise, being slower, was given a head start and waited confidently at the starting line. Achilles prepared to chase from behind. Once the race began, as expected, the tortoise took an early lead while Achilles quickly caught up. When Achilles reached the point marked A, the tortoise had slowly moved to point B. According to Zeno's setup, Achilles had to reach point B to catch up with the tortoise. But by the time he arrived at B, the tortoise had advanced to point C. This process seemed to go on indefinitely, leading spectators to wonder if Achilles could ever catch up with the tortoise.

One of the drivers was a young man dressed in a black evening suit, seemingly on his way to a high-end gathering. Although his jacket remained immaculate, the hems of his trousers and his shoes were muddied. He told Conan that he and his friend Julie were en route to a \"vintage jazz\" themed dance party. As they were joyfully driving to their destination, an out-of-control vehicle suddenly crossed the centerline, forcing him to swerve off the road and ultimately crash into a tree.

Having known each other for only a week, the intense emotions between them led to a decision not to wait any longer and to start their life journey together immediately. After the wedding, they decided to take a luxury cruise for their honeymoon, looking forward to enjoying romantic moments at sea. A sightseeing cruise ship was docked at the pier, its deck adorned with colorful flowers and its hull gleaming metallically in the sunlight, dazzlingly bright. As they boarded the ship, they were warmly greeted by two uniformed second-class sailors, especially with smiles and nods to Ella. Schindler seemed quite familiar with the ship, expertly guiding Ella through the crowd of passengers straight to cabin B13. The cabin was luxuriously decorated, with endless sea views from the window, allowing them both to finally relax.\n\nHowever, behind this oceanic romance lurked a conspiracy. Ella entrusted all her assetsâ$20,000âto Schindler, hoping he would deposit it with the purser for safekeeping. But after Schindler left, he disappeared without a trace. As the ship's horn sounded, the cruise slowly left the dock, and Ella searched the deck for her husband but found nothing. Trying to return to her cabin, she realized she was lost and couldn't even find cabin B13. The attendant informed her that there was no B13 cabin and that she had actually booked cabin B16. More shockingly, there was no record of Schindler's name in the register, and the purser had not received the $20,000 in cash.

At 8 p.m., as the park lights began to glow, a passerby on a stroll discovered Bruno's body on a bench near the lake. Bruno was dressed in a dark blue suit, looking very formal, but puzzlingly, there was a bullet hole through his left temple, and he was clearly deceased. Notably, his right arm had been in a heavy cast from fingertip to elbow since an accident at the factory last month.

However, when the great detective Dubin received the news and immediately arrived at the scene, he noticed some unusual details.
